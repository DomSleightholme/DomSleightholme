### Hello there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Dom Sleightholme and I am a second year BSc Computing & Games Development at The University of Plymouth. During my degree, I have developed a range of skills which have been used in all aspects of games development. I have always been designed focused and using my imagination to develop fun and immersive experiences. I have always had a passion for immersive experiences from games such as Jedi Fallen Order and Skyrim, these types of games to me are more like experiences and something I have passion about. I have always enjoyed using my imagination to create fun experiences such as my early days playing with Lego to taking my creativity further to develop fun exciting worlds in games such as Minecraft and Terraria.
